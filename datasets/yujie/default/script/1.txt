I barely had my bride for three minutes before she was taken by my adoptive father. If Dong Zhuo is now my father, then Diao Chan naturally becomes my bride. The messenger thought I would explode with rage, but to his surprise, I remained eerily calm. Diao Chan was taken by Dong Zhuo — what does that have to do with me, a mere transmigrator? But now that I'm Lu Bu, I certainly won't stay in his shadow for long.

“史金啊，你不是最爱我的吗？为什么不能容忍我有两个‘老公’呢！你既然为我生、为我死，为我而奋斗，你赚的钱为什么不能全部都给我呢……”

I stood there, a mere soul, watching as the woman who had once been my wife, Chen Jinlian, spoke with such audacity. The crematorium workers placed a bone ash jar in front of me, a small pit dug into the cold, barren mountain. They stepped back, their faces devoid of any sorrow. Chen Jinlian, with her exquisite features and alluring figure, looked at me with disdain.

“这他妈就是你**加害我的理由？无耻至极！” I raged internally, my soul seething with fury. If I were still in my physical form, I would have lunged at them, tearing them apart with my bare hands. For seven years, I had been her loyal dog, chasing after her since my student days. When my career took a turn for the better, I finally won her over during a period of her heartbreak. I spent twenty-eight thousand and eight hundred in betrothal gifts to marry her. After our marriage, I cherished her, treating her like a fragile treasure, working tirelessly to build a fortune of tens of millions. Yet, she not only rejected my family but also treated me with contempt, spending lavishly on herself while doing nothing. And despite all this, she still cheated on me, poisoning me and hastily cremating my body, burying me in this desolate wilderness.

Ye Xiaotian, her lover, approached the bone ash jar with a mocking grin. “史金啊史金啊！窝囊了那么多年，好不容易有个漂亮老婆！偏偏要得罪她，现在变成一堆灰！啥也没了！何苦哀哉！”

“是他逼我这么做的，谁让他之前发现我们的事情后，想让我净身出户来着！混蛋！他耽误了女人最宝贵的青春，却想吃干抹净……” Chen Jinlian retorted, her voice dripping with venom.

My soul was on the brink of exploding with rage. I wished I could become a vengeful ghost, tearing these two apart for eternity. But alas, I could do nothing.

“滴滴~” The sound of car horns echoed from the mountainside. A group of cars arrived, and out stepped a woman in a white suit, black checkered shirt, and red high heels. Her long, slightly curled hair danced in the wind. She was Qin Shuang, the sole female chairman of Huasheng Group, and the beloved princess of the Qin family, a powerhouse in the financial world of Shanghai. Her presence commanded respect, and those around her instinctively kept their distance.

She had been at a new product launch when she received a call, her expression darkening as she left abruptly. Reporters and guests followed her curiosity.

Qin Shuang was seven years older than me. She had supported me since high school, providing resources and connections during my entrepreneurial ventures. She had always been like a gentle, caring elder to me, yet I had treated her as nothing more than a sister or an aunt. She had warned me repeatedly not to pursue Chen Jinlian, even arguing with me over it. She had jokingly suggested marriage, but I had always blushed and refused, seeing her as a "brother" rather than a potential partner.

Chen Jinlian, noticing the sudden arrival, demanded, “你是谁？你有什么事？”

Qin Shuang ignored her, walking straight to my bone ash jar. She caressed it gently, as if whispering to a lover. “都说女追男隔层纱，不知是年龄还是身份……让你一直都把我无视！”

Ye Xiaotian stepped forward, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “哟，看你这痴情的样子，你就是史金的那个老相好吧！听说你大他七岁——”

Before he could finish, Qin Shuang suddenly stood up, her hand pulling out a pen from her pocket. With a swift motion, she stabbed it into Ye Xiaotian's neck, blood spraying out. He fell to the ground, struggling for a moment before going still.

The onlookers were stunned, the reporters snapping photos. Qin Shuang's bodyguards quickly surrounded the scene.

Qin Shuang, her hands covered in blood, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her demeanor cold and ruthless. She grabbed a white cloth from the ground and wrapped it tightly around Chen Jinlian's neck. “救命……” Chen Jinlian struggled, but she was no match for Qin Shuang, a national martial arts champion. Within moments, Chen Jinlian's face turned black, and she collapsed, dead.

The crowd was in shock. Qin Shuang had just killed two people in broad daylight, jeopardizing her hard-earned power, status, and wealth.

“安静！” Qin Shuang's voice cut through the chaos, silencing everyone. Even the police hesitated to approach her. Her presence was overwhelming, commanding respect and fear.

“妹妹~” A man pushed through the crowd, his eyes filled with fury. It was Qin Shuang's older brother, Qin Feng. He had confronted me several times, even beating me once.

Qin Shuang looked at her brother, a sad smile on her lips. “三哥，请代我为父母敬孝了！当初，我一时心软，没有坚持嫁给他，这才导致他被**妇所害……今天，我随他去了！”

“不要……” Qin Feng tried to stop her, but Qin Shuang raised a hand to halt him. With a swift motion, she slashed her own throat, blood spraying out, painting the world red.

Qin Feng roared in despair, tears streaming down his face. He knew how hard Qin Shuang had worked, how lonely she had been, despite her success and beauty.

Qin Shuang stumbled to my bone ash jar. “史金，这辈子，下辈子，生生世世，我们都要在一起……” She collapsed onto the jar, her blood staining the ground.

The crowd erupted in screams and cries. My soul was in turmoil, realizing that the woman I had always taken for granted had avenged me and died for me.

As I was lost in thought, a blinding light erupted from the bone ash jar. My vision blurred, and when it cleared, I found myself lying on a luxurious bed, naked, with bloodstains on the sheets. I felt a sharp pain in my arm, and when I looked, I saw that the agate stone around my neck had changed color.

“它带着我重生了！” I thought, bewildered.

The door opened, and a familiar figure walked in. Qin Shuang's cold gaze met mine, making me nervous. But I had changed, my soul having grown stronger. I met her gaze without flinching, causing her to look away.

“堂堂七尺男儿，看你这没出息的样！不就是表白被女生拒绝吗？要死不活的，天下美女多的是，没了她你又不是活不下去！”

If I were the naive young man I once was, I would have agreed wholeheartedly. But now, I knew better.

“再说了，你们都还是上学的小屁孩，别成天想情情爱爱的……干点正事，你优秀了，自然能吸引更优秀的女孩子……” Qin Shuang scolded, throwing me some clothes.
