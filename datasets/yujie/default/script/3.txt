I took out my phone and stared at the photo of myself wearing the agate stone, lost in thought. My heart was filled with gratitude and relief. I began to formulate my plans.

As a wealthy and influential family, the Qin family, especially the Qin Five Tigers, would certainly not allow Qin Shuang to be with someone like me, a commoner from the lower strata.

I remembered that during this period, a rich second-generation named Dai was madly pursuing her. She had mentioned him to me several times.

I looked at myself in the mirror while brushing my teeth. The young me had the naivety and simplicity of an ordinary person. With the soul of my previous life, I naturally knew how to dress up! I decided to change my appearance!

The villa's door was pushed open, and a young man with a big back hairstyle and dressed in a beige suit, accompanied by a bodyguard, walked in with an arrogant demeanor. The moment he entered, he scanned the room and then looked at me with a frosty expression.

"Where's Qin Shuang? I've been trying to call her, but she's not picking up!" The young man spoke disdainfully, looking down at me with his nose in the air.

The bodyguard, Dong, quickly replied, "Wei Shao, Miss Qin has already gone to the company!"

Dai Hongwei frowned and stared at me for a while before saying, "So you're that country boy Qin Shuang has been sponsoring?"

I calmly continued eating my breakfast. With my current mindset, I wasn't intimidated by his prestige. If it were my younger self from the past, I would have already stood up nervously.

"Kid, you need to recognize your place. You're just a poor student. If it weren't for Qin Shuang's kindness, sponsoring your education, you'd probably still be somewhere moving bricks!"

"Study hard and when you've learned something, come work for my company!" The young man left without even turning his head, swaggering all the way.

I watched as the young man got into his luxury car and left. My mouth curled into a cold smile. This man was Dai Hongwei, the son of the Dai family, one of Qin Shuang's persistent pursuers, and he had a good relationship with Qin Feng.

Dai Hongwei's appearance put immense pressure on me. From Qin Shuang's reaction this morning, I felt that she hadn't fallen deeply in love with me as she did in my previous life. After all, I had always kept my distance from her before. My path was still long.

"Tch, what's with the arrogance? If it weren't for your old man, you wouldn't be better than me," the bodyguard Dong said, looking disdainfully at the swaggering Dai Hongwei.

"Dong Ge, we shouldn't belittle ourselves. He may not be capable, but he knows how to be born into a good family! At least in that regard, we can't compare," I corrected.

Dong was a special forces soldier who had been trained in ancient martial arts since childhood. The Qin family had hired him at a high price as a bodyguard. Since he was five years older than me, we had a good rapport.

Hearing this, Dong said, "It's just a good birth, that's all. Jin Shao, Miss Qin has instructed me to accompany you these days. Where do you want to go? We can go from 'poor to parks and squares, rich to bars and clubs.' I'll arrange it."

I replied with a black face, "Go away, I'm still a kid... I don't have the leisure to play around right now! I just want to make money."

I suddenly realized that I had quietly become a man since last night!

I put on a white shirt that Qin Shuang had bought for me and left the villa. I found a barber shop and had a new hairstyle designed for myself. The once timid and naive college student instantly transformed into a confident and strikingly handsome man.

This drastic change left Dong, who was following me, wide-eyed with astonishment: "No wonder Miss Qin treats you so well. Jin Shao, you're so handsome that it makes me jealous!"

I laughed and said, "People rely on clothes, and horses rely on saddles. Of course, hairstyles are also important. As the saying goes, 'A head can be cut off, but the hairstyle must not be messed up!'"

Hearing this, Dong nodded thoughtfully and touched his square flat head. He was obsessed with martial arts and found it difficult to understand other things.


My phone rang, and I saw the name "心莲" on the screen. I hesitated for a moment, realizing it was Chen Jinlian's call. I didn't want to answer, so I hung up, but she called again immediately.

"What is it?" I answered impatiently, my tone cold.

"Shi Jin, students should prioritize their studies. Although you've been very nice to me, I... I want to focus on my studies first!"

"As a man, don't be so petty. It's just one rejection, and you're giving up on me? You keep saying how much you love me, but you can't handle a little setback?"

"If you don't keep being nice to me and keep pursuing me, how can you prove you really love me? Besides, I'm the school flower, and there are many guys chasing me. Why should I choose you? Think about it, we were from two different worlds!"

"Is your love so weak that it can't withstand a little test?"

Hearing this, my mouth twitched. This was the logic of a "little fairy"—every man in the world had to unconditionally be nice to her, to fawn over her?! In my previous life, I was naive and thought this was a signal from her, so I became even more devoted, clinging to my belief in love! But after graduation, she chose a rich second-generation boyfriend, and after being dumped a few months later, she saw that my business was picking up and finally accepted me, who had been fawning over her all along.

Now, hearing this, I felt utterly disgusted. "Chen Jinlian, are you out of your mind? Only flies keep circling around a pile of shit~"

Chen Jinlian frowned and shouted, "Shi Jin, what did you say?"

I sighed helplessly, "Forget it, I'll find a master to learn some animal language or something, and then we can communicate without barriers! Goodbye, beast girl!"

Chen Jinlian exploded in anger, "Shi Jin, you..."

I quickly hung up the phone to avoid her magical attacks.

Ah, that felt good! I let out a long breath, feeling much better.
