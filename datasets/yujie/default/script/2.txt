I stood there, frozen, as memories flooded back. I had been reborn after my third failed proposal to Chen Jinlian. Drunk and heartbroken, Qin Shuang had taken me back to her home. The night before, I had poured my heart out under Chen Jinlian's dorm, only to be rejected in front of many. My pride shattered, I had posted a desperate message on social media. In my sorrow, I had bought a bottle of liquor and drank until I passed out on the street. Qin Shuang found me and brought me to her villa. In my drunken state, I had taken her innocence.

I glanced at the red spots on the bedsheet, realizing she was trying to destroy the evidence. To my shock, she was still a virgin. Despite my past mistreatment, she had never complained and had always been kind to me. This time, I vowed to make it right.

"霜姐, I will take responsibility. Be my woman. I will give you everything. This life, I will not let you down," I said, looking at her with determination.

Qin Shuang visibly trembled, her eyes darting away, her face flushing. "You little rascal, taking advantage of me after a failed proposal?" she snapped, though her voice trembled. "I'm not your consolation prize. Are you still drunk?"

I grabbed her hand. "霜姐, I mean it. I've realized. I'm going to embrace your kindness. Youth doesn't know the value of an elder's love, mistaking it for mere infatuation. From now on, you are my love."

Her face turned even redder. "You must be out of your mind. Suddenly changing your tune? I don't believe it. Calm down first."

I smiled. "I'm perfectly calm. Youth is blind to true love, trapped in a maze of infatuation. Now, looking back, the real love was always in your care."

Qin Shuang hit me with the bedsheet, laughing. "You smooth talker. If you're sincere, forget about Chen Jinlian. Start a new, positive life. It's better than teasing your 霜姐."

As she walked away, her steps were awkward. I felt a surge of affection. "霜姐, I will take responsibility for last night. I want to keep the bedsheet as a testament to our love."

"You're really out of it," Qin Shuang said, closing the door quickly, her face as red as a coal.

She was twenty-six, from a wealthy background, and had met many talented men. But being flirted with by someone seven years younger made her flustered. Three years ago, she had taken a liking to me and treated me like a younger brother. But as time passed, I appeared more and more in her dreams. Last night, after my heartbreak, she had cared for me. In my drunken state, I had mistaken her for Chen Jinlian. Despite pushing me away twice, she had eventually given in, seeing my desperation.

In the bathroom, she struggled with her thoughts, worried about me. She opened the door to check on me and decided to dispose of the bedsheet, which held the mark of her lost innocence. But my sudden change of heart made her heart race. She had jokingly expressed her feelings before, but I had always treated her like a sibling, leaving her in a state of indecision. Now, hearing me say she should be my woman, she was filled with conflicting emotions.

She looked at the bedsheet in her hand, unable to bring herself to wash it. Instead, she carefully placed it in a box. "Maybe... he really has realized my worth," she thought.

I watched Qin Shuang, filled with joy. "霜姐, this life, I won't let you down or make you sad..."

I thought about pursuing Qin Shuang, and I remembered her five brothers, the Qin Five Tigers. Each of them was formidable, and in my previous life, I hadn't even gotten close to her before being tormented by Qin Nan. Now, they were undoubtedly the biggest obstacles.

As for that white lotus, Chen Jinlian, whom I had groveled after for years in my past life, screw her!

The text message notification rang.

**杨自奎:** "Gold, don't do anything stupid! Women are like clothes, if you can't buy one, just switch to another. It's just a rejection, so what? Goodbye and the next one will be better!"

**杨自奎:** "The new semester is starting soon, cheer up! Second year, a wonderful college life can make you forget all your troubles! I heard there are some public classes where you'll be with freshmen girls. And the seniors will dress up more maturely!"

**史金:** "You're a waste as an informant, is the start of school really that great?"

**杨自奎:** "I tried it yesterday, it's awesome!"

**史金:** "!?"

I suddenly remembered that Yang Zikui was my best friend in college. We had a great relationship during our university years. Later, when I started my business, Yang Zikui was a great help. It was under his support that I managed to succeed in my venture. Yang Zikui was a talkative and somewhat lewd guy.

**杨自奎:** "Oh right, Jin, should I send a cake to the campus belle and try to win her back?"

My thoughts snapped back to the present. I hadn't mistaken the timing. The campus belle Yang Zikui mentioned was none other than Chen Jinlian. The same woman who treated me like a beast of burden in my previous life, who eventually cheated on me and poisoned me. Now that I've been reborn, who the hell would continue to be a pure love lapdog?! If I'm going to be pure, it'll be for the right person—Qin Shuang!

**史金:** "Send what, damn it!"

**杨自奎:** "Jin, dad is willing to go to the ends of the earth for you, but I can't castrate myself for you! Let's not send it, okay? Let's do something else!"

**史金:** "..."

What a fool!
