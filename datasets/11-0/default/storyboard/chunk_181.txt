Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally, and the baby alternated between sneezing and howling without a moment’s pause.
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat sitting on the hearth, grinning from ear to ear.
“Please would you tell me,” I said, a little timidly, “why your cat grins like that?”

“It’s a Cheshire cat,” the Duchess replied, “and that’s why.
Pig!”

Her sudden outburst made me jump, but I realized she was addressing the baby, not me.
