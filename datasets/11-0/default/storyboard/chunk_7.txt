and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off my knowledge, as there was no one to listen to me, still it was good practice to say
it over) "—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?"
(I had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
