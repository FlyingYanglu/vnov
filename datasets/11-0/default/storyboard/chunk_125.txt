I noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into my head.
“If I eat one of these cakes,” I thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller,
I suppose.”
“A barrowful of what?”
