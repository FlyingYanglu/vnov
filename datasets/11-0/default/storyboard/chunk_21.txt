had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked "poison," so I ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry
-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) I very soon finished it off.
"What a curious feeling!"
