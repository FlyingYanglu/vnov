I was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but I felt that there was no time to be lost, as I was shrinking rapidly; so I set to work at

My chin was pressed so closely against my foot, that there was hardly room to open my mouth; but I did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of
the lefthand bit.
