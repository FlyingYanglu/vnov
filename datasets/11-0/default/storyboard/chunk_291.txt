e game was in such confusion that I never knew whether it was my turn or not.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to me an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the
only difficulty was, that my flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where I could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.
