The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to me to f
ind myself talking familiarly with them, as if I had known them all my life.
I had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this I would
not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
