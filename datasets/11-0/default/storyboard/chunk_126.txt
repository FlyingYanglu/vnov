So I swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that I began shrinking directly.
As soon as I was small enough to get through the door, I ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
They all made a rush at me the moment I appeared; but I ran off as hard as I could, and soon found myself safe in a thick wood.
