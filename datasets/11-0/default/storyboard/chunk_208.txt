It was so large a house, that I did not like to go nearer till I had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised myself to about two

Even then, I walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to myself, “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”

I approached the house and saw a table set out under a tree.
