“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”
I drew my foot as far down the chimney as I could, and waited till I heard a little animal (I couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scram
bling about in the chimney close above me: then, saying to myself “This is Bill,” I gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
