The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea, with a Dormouse fast asleep between them.
The two were using the Dormouse as a cushion, their elbows resting on it as they talked over its head.
"Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," I thought, though it didn't seem to mind being asleep.
The table was large, but the three of them were crowded together at one corner.
