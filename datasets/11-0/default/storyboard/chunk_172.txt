When I peeked out again, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the Frog-Footman was sitting on the ground, staring up at the sky.
I approached the door timidly and knocked.
The Frog-Footman, still staring up, said, “There’s no sort of use in knocking, and that for two reasons.
First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.”
