        "summary": "In this segment of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,' Alice finds herself growing to an enormous size, causing her to cry uncontrollably and create a pool of tears. She then shrinks to a tiny size due to the fan she was holding, leading her to swim in her own tears. While in the pool, she encounters a Mouse and attempts to communicate with it, but their conversation is interrupted by her mentioning cats, which the Mouse strongly dislikes. The Mouse eventually agrees to share its history if Alice promises not to discuss cats or dogs. The pool becomes crowded with other animals and birds, all of whom have fallen into the pool, and they all swim to the shore together.",
