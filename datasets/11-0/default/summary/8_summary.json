        "summary": "Alice arrives at the Queen’s croquet-ground, where she witnesses three gardeners painting white roses red to avoid the Queen’s wrath. The Queen, known for her quick temper and frequent executions, arrives with a grand procession, including soldiers, courtiers, and royal children. Alice is questioned by the Queen and stands her ground, even when threatened with beheading. The gardeners seek Alice’s protection, and she hides them in a flower-pot. The Queen initiates a chaotic game of croquet, using live hedgehogs and flamingoes as equipment, which leads to constant disputes and threats of execution. Alice befriends the Cheshire Cat, who provides her with company and commentary on the bizarre events. The game descends into further chaos, with the Queen’s frequent outbursts and the disappearance of the Cheshire Cat, leading to a dispute between the King, Queen, and executioner. Alice ultimately decides to leave the game, unsure of her place in this strange world.",
