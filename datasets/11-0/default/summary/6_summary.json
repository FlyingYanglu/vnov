        "summary": "Alice encounters a series of bizarre characters and events as she attempts to enter a house. She first meets two footmen, one resembling a fish and the other a frog, who deliver an invitation to the Duchess from the Queen. Inside the house, Alice finds the Duchess, her baby, and a cook in a chaotic kitchen filled with pepper and noise. The Duchess's baby unexpectedly turns into a pig, which Alice releases into the woods. Alice then converses with the Cheshire Cat, who provides cryptic advice and vanishes mysteriously. The chapter ends with Alice deciding to visit the March Hare, pondering the strange transformations and encounters she has experienced.",
