        "summary": "In this segment, Alice finds herself in a courtroom where the King and Queen of Hearts preside over the trial of the Knave of Hearts, accused of stealing tarts. The courtroom is filled with various creatures, including the White Rabbit, the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The trial is chaotic, with jurors writing down their names on slates, the Hatter providing confusing testimony, and the Queen demanding the execution of anyone who displeases her. Alice, feeling herself grow larger, becomes increasingly frustrated with the absurdity of the proceedings. The trial is interrupted by the Queen's outbursts and the disappearance of the cook, who was the next witness. The segment ends with the White Rabbit calling Alice as the next witness, setting up the next phase of the trial.",
