        "summary": "Alice attends a bizarre tea party hosted by the March Hare and the Hatter, where the Dormouse is used as a cushion and falls asleep frequently. The party is filled with nonsensical conversations, riddles with no answers, and constant movement around the table. The Hatter complains about his malfunctioning watch, which always shows six o'clock, leading to an endless tea-time. Alice struggles to engage in meaningful conversation and eventually leaves the party in frustration, vowing never to return. She then discovers a door in a tree that leads her back to the garden.",
