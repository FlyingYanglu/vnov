        "summary": "In the courtroom, Alice finds herself growing larger and more frustrated with the absurd trial of the Knave of Hearts. The King and Queen demand Alice's evidence, but she claims to know nothing about the case. The trial is further complicated by the introduction of a mysterious set of verses, which the King and jury struggle to interpret. Alice challenges the King's logic and refuses to leave the court despite being declared too tall. The Queen insists on pronouncing the sentence before the verdict, leading to chaos. Alice, now fully grown, defies the Queen and declares the courtroom a pack of cards, causing the trial to dissolve into absurdity.",
