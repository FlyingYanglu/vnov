        "summary": "Alice, bored and curious, follows a talking White Rabbit into a rabbit-hole, leading her into a fantastical journey. She falls down a deep well, encountering peculiar objects like a jar labeled 'ORANGE MARMALADE' and a tiny golden key. Alice discovers a small door leading to a beautiful garden but finds herself too large to enter. She consumes a bottle labeled 'DRINK ME,' shrinking to a tiny size, and then eats a cake labeled 'EAT ME,' hoping to either grow or shrink further to access the garden. Throughout her adventure, Alice displays curiosity, bravery, and a sense of wonder, navigating a series of surreal and whimsical challenges.",
