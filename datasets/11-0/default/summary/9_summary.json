        "summary": "Alice encounters the Duchess, who is unusually friendly and fond of finding morals in everything. The Duchess engages Alice in a conversation filled with cryptic sayings and moral lessons, often digging her sharp chin into Alice's shoulder. The conversation is interrupted by the sudden arrival of the Queen, who threatens the Duchess with immediate execution. The Duchess flees, and Alice is left to continue the game of croquet under the Queen's watchful and volatile presence. The Queen's frequent outbursts and threats of execution create a chaotic atmosphere. Alice eventually meets the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, who share a sad and nostalgic story about their education in the sea, including lessons in Reeling, Writhing, and other peculiar subjects. The Mock Turtle's tale is filled with melancholy and a longing for a simpler past.",
