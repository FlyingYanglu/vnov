 It was as much as I could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye;
 but to get through was more hopeless than ever.
 I sat down and began to cry again.
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,”
 I said to myself, “a great girl like you, to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!”
