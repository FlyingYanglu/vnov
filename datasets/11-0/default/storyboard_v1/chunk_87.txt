but I got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to myself, as usual.
 “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?”
 As I said this, I came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
 “Whoever lives there,”
 I thought, “it’ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!”
 So I began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till I had brought myself down to nine inches high.
I stood there, staring at the quaint little house, trying to figure out my next move.
 Suddenly, a footman in livery came rushing out of the woods.
