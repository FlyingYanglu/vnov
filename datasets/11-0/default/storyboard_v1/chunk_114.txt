It was so large a house, that I did not like to go nearer till I had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised myself to about two feet high.
 Even then, I walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to myself, “Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”
---I approached the house and saw a table set out under a tree.
 The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea, with a Dormouse fast asleep between them.
 The two were using the Dormouse as a cushion, their elbows resting on it as they talked over its head.
 "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,"
 I thought, though it didn't seem to mind being asleep.
The table was large, but the three of them were crowded together at one corner.
