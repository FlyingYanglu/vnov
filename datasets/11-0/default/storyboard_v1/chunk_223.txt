I panted as we ran;
 but the Gryphon only answered “Come on!”
 and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed us, the melancholy words:—“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
---The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him;
 and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.
 In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made me quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,”
 I thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”
 But there seemed to be no chance of this, so I began looking at everything about me, to pass away the time.
