I thought, "it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."
 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that I had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so I went back to the table, half hoping I might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes.
 This time I found a little bottle on it.
 "Which certainly was not here before,"
 I said to myself.
 Round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME,"
 beautifully printed on it in large letters.
