It was talking in a hurried, nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing me.
 Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion.
 Last of all this grand procession, came the King and Queen of Hearts.
I was rather doubtful whether I ought not to lie down on my face like the three gardeners, but I couldn’t remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions.
 “And besides, what would be the use of a procession,”
 I thought, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?”
 So I stood still where I was and waited.
When the procession came opposite to me, they all stopped and looked at me.
