 He rapped loudly on the door with his knuckles.
 The door opened to reveal another footman, this one with a round face and large eyes like a frog.

The Fish-Footman produced a large letter from under his arm, nearly as big as himself, and handed it to the Frog-Footman, saying in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.”
 The Frog-Footman repeated, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”
 They both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
