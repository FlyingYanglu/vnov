“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”
I drew my foot as far down the chimney as I could, and waited till I heard a little animal (I couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above me: then, saying to myself “This is Bill,”
 I gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
The first thing I heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”
 then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!”
 then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,”
 I thought,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
