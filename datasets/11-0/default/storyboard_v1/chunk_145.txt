This piece of rudeness was more than I could bear: I got up in great disgust, and walked off;
 the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of my going, though I looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after me: the last time I saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!”
 I said as I picked my way through the wood.
 “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”
Just as I said this, I noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.
