“I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”
“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,”
 I said, who was a very truthful child;
 “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”
“I don’t believe it,”
 the Pigeon said;
 “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”
This was such a new idea to me, that I was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”
