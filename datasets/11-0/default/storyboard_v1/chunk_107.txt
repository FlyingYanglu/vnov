“What sort of people live about here?”
“In that direction,”
 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,”
 waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”
“But I don’t want to go among mad people,”
 I remarked.
“Oh, you can’t help that,”
 said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”
