This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and I felt that it would be quite absurd for me to carry it further.
So I set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.
 “If it had grown up,”
 I said to myself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes a rather pretty pig, I think.”
---And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—”
 when I was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
 The Cat only grinned when it saw me.
 It looked good-natured, I thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so I felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
