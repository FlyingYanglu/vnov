But I went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round me, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
After a time, I heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and I hastily dried my eyes to see what was coming.
 It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.
 He came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”
I felt so desperate that I was ready to ask help of anyone.
 So, when the Rabbit came near me, I began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—”
 The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
I took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, I kept fanning myself all the time I went on talking.
