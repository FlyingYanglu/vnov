In my haste, I tipped over the jury-box, sending the jurymen sprawling onto the heads of the crowd below.
 It reminded me of the time I accidentally upset a globe of goldfish.
 "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!"
 I exclaimed, feeling great dismay as I quickly began picking them up, trying to put them back into the jury-box before they could die.
The King, in a very grave voice, said, "The trial cannot proceed until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesâ€”_all_."
 He emphasized the word "all"
 and looked hard at me as he said it.
 I glanced at the jury-box and saw that I had put the Lizard head downwards.
