said the King;
 and the White Rabbit blewthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
The first witness was the Hatter.
 He came in with a teacup in one handand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
 “I beg pardon, yourMajesty,”
 he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finishedmy tea when I was sent for.”
“You ought to have finished,”
 said the King.
