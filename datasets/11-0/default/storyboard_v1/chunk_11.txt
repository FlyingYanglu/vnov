I said;
 “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”
 And so it was indeed: I was now only ten inches high, and my face brightened up at the thought that I was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
 First, however, I waited for a few minutes to see if I was going to shrink any further.
 I felt a little nervous about this;
 “for it might end,”
 I said to myself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?”
 And I tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for I could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
