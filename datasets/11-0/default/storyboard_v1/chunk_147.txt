Once more I found myself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.
 “Now, I’ll manage better this time,”
 I said to myself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
 Then I went to work nibbling at the mushroom (I had kept a piece of it in my pocket) till I was about a foot tall.
 Then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
---I found myself near a large rose-tree at the entrance of the garden.
 The roses on it were white, but three gardeners were busily painting them red.
 This seemed very curious to me, so I went closer to watch.
