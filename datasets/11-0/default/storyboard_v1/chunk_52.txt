Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.
 I knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for me, and I trembled till I shook the house, quite forgetting that I was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
 Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
 but, as the door opened inwards, and my elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.
 I heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”
 “_That_ you won’t!”
 I thought, and, after waiting till I fancied I heard the Rabbit just under the window, I suddenly spread out my hand, and made a snatch in the air.
 I did not get hold of anything, but I heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which I concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
