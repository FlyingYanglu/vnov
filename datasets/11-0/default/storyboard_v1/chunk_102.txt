I thought, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?”
 I said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
“Don’t grunt,”
 I said;
 “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.”
The baby grunted again, and I looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.
 There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose;
 also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether I did not like the look of the thing at all.
