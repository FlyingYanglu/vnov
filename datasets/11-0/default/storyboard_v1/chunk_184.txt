” I said to myself, for I had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.We very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “
Up, lazy thing!
” said the Queen, “
and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.
 I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered.
”---I watched as the Queen walked off, leaving me alone with the Gryphon. I did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole, I thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen. So I waited.The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes. Then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight. Then it chuckled. "
What fun!
" said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to me."
