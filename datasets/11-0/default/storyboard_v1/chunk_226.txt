“They’re putting down their names,”
 the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”
 “Stupid things!”
 I began in a loud, indignant voice, but I stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!”
 and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
I could see, as well as if I were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!”
 on their slates, and I could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,”
 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.
