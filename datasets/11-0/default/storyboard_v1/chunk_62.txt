and the moment I appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;
 then I, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again;
 then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to me a good opportunity for making my escape;
 so I set off at once, and ran till I was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
 “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!”
 I said, as I leant against a buttercup to rest myself, and fanned myself with one of the leaves.
I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it!
