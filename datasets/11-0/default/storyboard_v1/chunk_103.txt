“But perhaps it was only sobbing,”
 I thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
No, there were no tears.
 “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”
 I said, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!”
 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and we went on for some while in silence.
I was just beginning to think to myself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?”
 when it grunted again, so violently, that I looked down into its face in some alarm.
