(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?”
 And here I began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to myself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?”
 and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?”
 for, you see, as I couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way I put it.
 I felt that I was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that I was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?”
 when suddenly, thump!
 thump!
 down I came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
