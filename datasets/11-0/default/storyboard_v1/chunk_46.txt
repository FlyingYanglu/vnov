“Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!”
 And here, poor me, I began to cry again, for I felt very lonely and low-spirited.
 In a little while, however, I again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and I looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.
---It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something.
 I heard it muttering to itself, “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?”
 I guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves.
 I very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since my swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed me, as I went hunting about, and called out to me in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!”
