I said to myself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”
It did so indeed, and much sooner than I had expected: before I had drunk half the bottle, I found my head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save my neck from being broken.
 I hastily put down the bottle, saying to myself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t.”

 I hastily put down the bottle, saying to myself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”
 Alas!
 it was too late to wish that!
 I went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and I tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round my head.
