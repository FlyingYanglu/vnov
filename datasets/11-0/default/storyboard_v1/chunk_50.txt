Still I went on growing, and, as a last resource, I put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to myself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and I grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of my ever getting out of the room again, no wonder I felt unhappy.
 “It was much pleasanter at home,”
 I thought, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,”
 I added in a sorrowful tone;
 “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”
“But then,”
 I thought, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”
