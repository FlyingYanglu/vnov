Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.
”It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it. There were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. I led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.---They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. I looked around at the Mouse, the Duck, the Dodo, the Lory, and the Eaglet. We were quite a sight, and I couldn't help but feel a bit out of place among them.The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to me to find myself talking familiarly with them, as if I had known them all my life. I had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “
I am older than you, and must know better;
” and this I would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “
Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
 _I’ll_ soon make you dry enough!
” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. I kept my eyes anxiously fixed on it, for I felt sure I would catch a bad cold if I did not get dry very soon.“
Ahem!
