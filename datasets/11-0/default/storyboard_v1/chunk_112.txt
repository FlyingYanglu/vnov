I said to myself;
 “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.”
 As I said this, I looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
---“Did you say pig, or fig?”
 said the Cat.
“I said pig,”
 I replied;
 “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
