As there seemed to be no chance of getting my hands up to my head, I tried to get my head down to them, and was delighted to find that my neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.
 I had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which I found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which I had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made me draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into my face, and was beating me violently with its wings.
“Serpent!”
 screamed the Pigeon.
“I’m _not_ a serpent!”
 I said indignantly.
 “Let me alone!”
“Serpent, I say again!”
