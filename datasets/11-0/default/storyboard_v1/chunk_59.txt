but I had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
 “I’ll put a stop to this,”
 I said to myself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!”
 which produced another dead silence.
I noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into my head.
 “If I eat one of these cakes,”
 I thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”
So I swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that I began shrinking directly.
