and in another moment it was out of sight.
I remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it;
 and as it was perfectly round, I found this a very difficult question.
 However, at last I stretched my arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
“And now which is which?”
 I said to myself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment I felt a violent blow underneath my chin: it had struck my foot!
I was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but I felt that there was no time to be lost, as I was shrinking rapidly;
 so I set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
