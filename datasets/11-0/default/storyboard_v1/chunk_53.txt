Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?”
 And then a voice I had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”
 “Digging for apples, indeed!”
 said the Rabbit angrily.
 “Here! Come and help me out of _this!_”
 (Sounds of more broken glass.) “Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”
---“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!”
 Pat’s voice echoed, pronouncing it “arrum.”
