I said to myself, “to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!”
 And I began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,”
 I went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!”
By this time I had found my way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as I had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves.
 I took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when my eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.
 There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,”
 but nevertheless I uncorked it and put it to my lips.
 “I know _something_ interesting is sure to happen,”
