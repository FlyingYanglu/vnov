“That’s very curious!”
 I thought.
 “But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.”
 And in I went.
Once more I found myself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.
 “Now, I’ll manage better this time,”
 I said to myself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
 Then I went to work nibbling at the mushroom (I had kept a piece of it in my pocket) till I was about a foot tall.
