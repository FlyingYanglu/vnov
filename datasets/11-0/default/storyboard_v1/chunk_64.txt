I stretched myself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and my eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of me or of anything else.
I stood there, staring into the eyes of the large blue Caterpillar, who was quietly smoking a long hookah.
 We remained silent for what felt like an eternity.
 Finally, the Caterpillar broke the silence, taking the hookah out of its mouth and addressing me in a languid, sleepy voice.
“Who are _you?_”
 the Caterpillar asked.
I felt a bit uneasy.
