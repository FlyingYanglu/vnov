---I was beginning to get very tired of sitting by my sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do.
 Once or twice, I had peeped into the book she was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.
 "And what is the use of a book,"
 I thought, "without pictures or conversations?"
So I was considering in my own mind (as well as I could, for the hot day made me feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by me.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
 nor did I think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!"
 (When I thought it over afterwards, it occurred to me that I ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
