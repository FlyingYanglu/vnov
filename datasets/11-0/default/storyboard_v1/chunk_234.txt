“Don’t talk nonsense,”
 I said more boldly: “you know you’re growingtoo.”
“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,”
 said the Dormouse: “not inthat ridiculous fashion.”
 And he got up very sulkily and crossed overto the other side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officersof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoesoff.
