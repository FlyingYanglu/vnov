the Caterpillar replied.
“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,”
 I said, “all I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”
“You!”
 the Caterpillar said contemptuously.
 “Who are _you?_”
The conversation seemed to loop back to the beginning, and I felt a little irritated by the Caterpillar’s short remarks.
 I drew myself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”
