said the Hatter.
I felt dreadfully puzzled.
 The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
 "I don’t quite understand you,"
 I said, as politely as I could.
 "The Dormouse is asleep again,"
 said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."
