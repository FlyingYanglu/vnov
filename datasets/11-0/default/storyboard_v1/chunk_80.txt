My chin was pressed so closely against my foot, that there was hardly room to open my mouth;
 but I did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
*      *      *      *      *      *      *    *      *      *      *      *      **      *      *      *      *      *      *“Come, my head’s free at last!”
 I said in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when I found that my shoulders were nowhere to be found: all I could see, when I looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below me.
“What _can_ all that green stuff be?”
 I wondered aloud.
 “And where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”
 I was moving them about as I spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
