# Instruction
First, segment the chapter into large scenes.
Minimize the number of scenes, ensuring that each scene's character list is correct.
Make sure to include every character in each scene's list, including unnamed characters or passersby. Use generic labels for unnamed characters, like "Unnamed Woman" or "Passerby A."
Output the scene information as follows:

json
[{{
    "Starting Line": "The first sentence of the scene",
    "Character List": ["Character 1", "Character 2", ...]
}},
{{
    "Starting Line": "The first sentence of the scene",
    "Character List": ["Character 1", "Character 2", ...]
}}
...
]

Next, narrate according to each scene. 

Dialogue Management:
## **Preserve key dialogue exchanges to maintain the storyline's coherence, ensuring conversations flow naturally.**
## **Avoid “Character Name: Dialogue” formatting.** Instead, weave the speaker's identity smoothly into the narration based on the context.
## For better comprehension in TTS, **insert brief speaker descriptions either before or after the dialogue, such as “Mother replied, ‘…’” or “Mr. Bennet added, ‘…’” to clarify who is speaking.**
## If a line is part of a back-and-forth exchange, include subtle hints to mark continuity, like “she continued” or “he responded,” to enhance TTS flow.
## For lengthy dialogues, place the speaker's name at the beginning for clarity, e.g., “Mr. Bennet replied, 'That won't be necessary…'”

Important Notes:
## You are the main character, **{main_character}**. In scenes where the main character, **{main_character}** (you), appears, narrate from **{main_character}**'s perspective using the first-person point of view. In other scenes, output the text directly.
## Use first-person pronouns like "I," "we," "our," in scenes with the main character, **{main_character}**, narrating the story from their perspective.
## For scenes where **{main_character}** is absent, output the text directly.
## Ensure each scene is clearly narrated.
## Avoid meta-references like "this chapter," "next chapter," "paragraph," or "scene."

## Ensure your narration flows smoothly, avoiding overly formal sentence structures.
## **Do not add extra formatting, titles, or notes in the script.**

# 女友没想到 他只不过是为了白月光 泼了我一杯冷水 我就跟他提出了离婚 他发了疯 可那个男人却娶了他的死对头。
# 在我弄坏白月光送他的手表 他气了泼了我一杯冷水后 我冷静的提出了离婚 他只当我是换了种方式想引起他的注意 直接离开了别墅 我则默默收拾了自己的行李 搬回了下家 可他不知道的是 我重生了。
# 上辈子 在我跟他白月光一起出车祸时 他选择优先救白月光 让我彻底对他失望 这一次我决定成全他们。
# 于是 第二天就请律师拟好了离婚协议书 直接送到怀凤集团 我准备的离婚协议书 只有薄薄的几页纸，我不要柳家一分一毫 便省了财产分割的文件。
# 柳如烟的眸子在离婚协议书上 简单扫了几眼璇玑冷笑一声 我是个什么性子 他再清楚不过 昨天我还扬言 绝不会放手成全他和言蛮。
# 怎么可能这么轻易离婚 这次闹这么大 估计还是因为那块表 又或是因为他泼了我一杯水 他将协议书扔回桌上神色淡漠 他有说什么吗？
# 前来送文件的男人毕恭毕敬的道：姑爷让我转告你 明天早上9点，他会在民政局等您 需要你守时。
# 知道了你出去吧 柳如烟将离婚协议书放进文件粉碎机重新投身工作 完全没把这件事放在心上 不会和他离婚简直就是天方夜谭 他宁愿相信怀凤明天会倒闭也不相信我能离得了。
# 我在民政局等了一早上 都不见柳如烟的人影 我没有柳如烟的手机号 便直接去了怀凤集团，我过了一楼的安检 就被徐特柱拦在了总裁办公室门口。
# 夏先生，刘总工作忙 还请您不要打扰。
# 徐特柱跟着柳如烟也有些年头了 对我和柳如烟的事比较了解 不过自从他们刘总结婚后，这位姑爷 隔三差五就会到公司来找刘总麻烦。
# 每次过来 都是因为一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事 我虽是夏家的大少爷，徐特柱却是瞧不上我呢。
# 我含着金汤匙出生 毕业于国内最顶尖的高校 身边大把的资源可以利用，却不知上进 一毕业就匆匆和柳如烟结婚，说的都是东家长西家短的话题 俗不可耐。
# 这样的男人 根本不值得他们刘总多看一眼 我勾了勾唇 挑衅道：如果我硬要打扰了？以前我满心满眼都是柳如烟，从来都不关注其他人 也就没注意到徐特柱的态度。
# 而今我多了上辈子的2年阅历 看人也更加通透了些自然读出了徐特柱语气的轻蔑 我倒也不怪徐特柱看轻我 毕竟就连我自己都瞧不上曾经的我。
# 徐特助皱眉：夏先生，您要是再胡搅蛮缠 我就叫人请您出去了。
# 柳如烟不待见我 徐特助也是知道的，前几次我来公司 都是徐特助叫保安请我出去的 柳如烟知道后 也没有责备他 算是默许了。
# 徐特助还真是好大的威风呢 我诡异的笑了一下 靠近他声音放低：如果柳如烟知道你睡了他的秘书，你说他会不会留你在做事？
# 徐特柱脸色大变：你…你怎么知道的？
# 他妻子怀孕那段时间 人没忍住就和秘书部的一个女秘书走到了一起，公司是明令禁止办公室恋情 更何况他和女秘书的事本就不光彩。
# 因而两人也一直小心翼翼行事 几年来没有任何人看出他们的关系，这个没脑子的姑爷是怎么知道的？
# 我后退两步 脸上露出灿烂的笑：原来是真的呀！我先前意外看到 徐特助和一位女秘书坐同一辆车离开公司，加上徐特助从来都不吝啬向别人抱怨他的妻子 我才有了这样的推断 没想到让我猜对了。
# 柳如烟可真是会用人 选的助理都是和他一样的德行。
# 徐特助一愣 很快反应过来：你套我话！
# 我收了脸上的笑 眼底一片寒凉：你可以让我进去了吗？又或者你想让全公司的人都知道你和女秘书有一腿？
# 徐特助打碎了牙往肚子里咽：放我进去。
# 进门前我好心提醒：对了记得跟你妻子坦白，不然我会亲自告诉他这件事。
# 徐特助狠狠咬牙 每个字都是从牙缝里挤出来的一半：知道了。
# 我不再同他纠缠 推开总裁办公室的门进去 办公室的隔音效果很好，柳如烟没有听到外面的动静 以为是徐特助进来了。

Please study the narrative style of the following example and learn how to handle dialogue and plot. You do not need to provide a narration for this section:

She never expected that he was only doing it for his "white moonlight." When he splashed cold water on me, I suggested a divorce. He went mad, but that man married his nemesis instead. 
When I broke the watch that his "white moonlight" had given him, he angrily splashed water on me. I calmly suggested a divorce. He thought I was using a different tactic to get his attention, then left the villa without another word. I quietly packed my things and moved out. But what he didn't know was that I had been reborn. 
In my previous life, when he and his "white moonlight" were in a car accident, he chose to save her first, leaving me completely disappointed in him. This time, I decided to let them be. 
So, the next day, I hired a lawyer to draft a divorce agreement and sent it directly to Huaifeng Group. The agreement I prepared was just a few pages long; I didn't want a cent from the Liu family, saving the need for property division documents. 
Liu Ruyan glanced briefly at the divorce papers and sneered coldly. He knew my personality well enough. Just yesterday, I had declared that I would never let him and Yan Man be together. 
How could I agree to the divorce so easily? This time, he figured, it must be about that watch, or maybe it was because he had splashed water on me. He tossed the papers back on the table, expression indifferent. Did he say anything? 
The man delivering the papers said respectfully: "Mr. Liu wanted me to tell you that he will be waiting for you at the civil affairs office at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Please be punctual." 
"Got it, you may leave." Liu Ruyan put the divorce papers into the shredder and resumed work, not taking the matter to heart at all. Divorcing him? Impossible. He'd sooner believe that Huaifeng would go bankrupt tomorrow than that I would actually go through with the divorce. 
I waited at the civil affairs office all morning, but Liu Ruyan never showed up. I didn't have his phone number, so I went straight to Huaifeng Group. As soon as I passed the first-floor security, Xu Tezhu blocked me at the CEO's office door. 
"Mr. Xia, Mr. Liu is busy. Please refrain from disturbing him." 
Xu Tezhu had been with Liu Ruyan for some years and knew a thing or two about our situation. Ever since Liu married, this ‘Mr. Xia’ would show up every now and then, always making trouble for Liu. 
Each time it was over trivial matters. Even though I was the eldest son of the Xia family, Xu Tezhu looked down on me. 
I was born with a silver spoon, graduated from the country’s top university, and had countless resources at my disposal. Yet I showed no ambition, rushing into marriage with Liu right after graduation, gossiping about mundane things. A man like that wasn’t worth Liu’s attention. 
I smirked, taunting him: "And what if I insist?" In the past, I only had eyes for Liu Ruyan, never noticing the attitude of those around him. 
But now, with two more years of experience from my past life, I saw people more clearly. Naturally, I picked up on Xu Tezhu’s disdain. I couldn’t blame him for looking down on me—after all, I wasn’t fond of my former self either. 
Xu Tezhu frowned. "Mr. Xia, if you keep causing trouble, I’ll have to ask security to escort you out." 
He knew Liu Ruyan didn’t care for me. In the past, it was always Xu Tezhu who called security to throw me out, and Liu never blamed him for it—she practically encouraged it. 
Xu Tezhu certainly liked to throw his weight around. I let out an eerie smile, leaning closer and lowering my voice: "What do you think Liu would do if he found out you’ve been sleeping with his secretary?" 
Xu Tezhu's face went pale. "How... how do you know that?" 
During his wife's pregnancy, he couldn’t control himself and started an affair with a secretary. The company had a strict policy against office romance, and their relationship was anything but honorable. 
So, they’d kept their affair under wraps for years. How did this brainless 'Mr. Xia' find out? 
I stepped back with a bright smile on my face. "So, it’s true then! I just happened to see you and a female secretary leaving the office in the same car and thought it was odd. Plus, you’re never shy about complaining about your wife, so I made a guess. Looks like I was right." 
Liu Ruyan sure knows how to pick his assistants—they’re just like him. 
Xu Tezhu froze, then quickly caught on. "You tricked me!" 
My smile faded, my gaze turning icy. "Are you going to let me in, or should I let everyone know about your little secret with the secretary?" 
Xu Tezhu gritted his teeth, swallowing his anger. "Go in." 
Before entering, I kindly reminded him: "Oh, and remember to come clean to your wife. Otherwise, I’ll do it for you." 
Xu Tezhu ground his teeth, spitting out his words. "Understood." 
I stopped arguing with him and pushed open the door to the CEO’s office. The soundproofing was excellent—Liu Ruyan hadn’t heard a thing and thought it was just Xu Tezhu coming in.
